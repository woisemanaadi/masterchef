Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Place a pizza stone or unrimmed baking sheet on the rack and preheat the oven to 200C.

In a frying pan over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the onion, ¼ teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are golden brown, about 10 minutes. If the onions begin to burn, reduce the heat and add a little water, 1 tablespoon at a time.

While the onions are cooking, in a large bowl, combine the honey, herbs, garlic, cayenne pepper and a light sprinkling of salt, and stir to combine. Add the cherry tomatoes and the slices of tomato. Gently toss to coat.

Place a piece of parchment paper that’s about 30-by-40cm on the counter. Stretch or roll out the pizza dough into a thin oval or rectangle, about 25-by-35cm, on top of the parchment.

Spread the creme fraiche over the dough, leaving a 2.5cm border around the edge. Scatter the browned onions and grated parmesan over, then arrange the tomatoes on top in a single layer. Scoop any stray herbs and garlic from the bowl and add to the pizza, leaving behind any accumulated juices. Discard the juices.

Using the parchment, lift the pizza and carefully transfer it to the hot pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust is browned. Scatter the burrata and additional fresh herbs, if using, over the hot pizza, drizzle with the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil, if using. Slice and serve.
